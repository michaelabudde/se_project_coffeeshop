## Plan on improving the project

I plan to improve the project by adding a link to a chat board that allow people to meet at the cafe. Sometimes people need some collective accountability to get what they need to done. The chat would allow people to post that they are interested in studying or working together and post the time they'll be there. This could help give the cafe the lively community feel it needs.
